Assignment coding during FCG course
This assignment about the detail about creating generated image (CGI) of the KLCC 
building and its vicinity using all OpenGL basic primitives. A picture of KLCC tower is chosen 
from internet to draw the CGI of KLCC. The picture below is the reference to convert it to 
2D graphics.

Strength and uniqueness
The strength of the image produced is every shape and lines not only have a single color, 
most of them have a combination at least two colors, that make the image more attractive.
Another strength of the CGI is the things almost have the same position with the original, 
this can be helping the output is more reality based on the structure of the buildings.
The uniqueness of the output is that the different color with original is used to explore more 
possibility of the combination of the color, this will also show the output is unique although 
others people use same picture for reference. Another uniqueness of the output is other 
elements like moon and trees is added into output that not in the original picture, I add 
them because some places is very empty and can also practice how to draw circle.

Sample output please view klcc.png
